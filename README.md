# SQL-AI-AutoModel-Function
This project demonstrates a fully automated no-code machine learning classification pipeline built entirely inside Databricks SQL using a Python UDF.  The solution performs EDA, feature analysis, hyperparameter generation, model training, model selection, persistence, and real-time inference all triggered directly from DBSQL.
